This simple JIRA plugin simply counts the number of +1s in an issue's comments and exposes them as a field in the issue
view and issue navigator screens.

Additionally, the user can search for issues with a specific range of +1s.

The need for this plugin arose because we essentially needed a way for our helpdesk guys to say "hey, this customer wants
that feature too". We wanted to do this via voting but since JIRA doesn't allow to vote more than one time per user (and
this is not going to change), this didn't work.

To use the plugin, just install it, add the "Plus One" custom field to your field configurations, reindex and you're done!

Feedback and pull requests are welcome, just don't hold me responsible for anything.
